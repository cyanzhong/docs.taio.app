## Privacy Policy

Taio is a text processing system for iOS and macOS that supports the use of custom actions to implement text workflows.

This privacy policy applies to the main app itself, its embedded frameworks and app extensions, and official examples we provided, but obviously not to actions that you, the user, create yourself. Especially when using networking APIs, please be aware that other terms (of the API service provider) may apply.

**Purchases**

As we mentioned in [pricing strategy](terms.md), Taio Pro offers a higher discount for early supporters, achieved by accessing the app's purchase items.

This information, which includes subscribed or paid in-app purchases, etc., is anonymous and unrelated to the user's identity, and Taio uses only the `initial download date` in it to determine if it is an early supporter.

**Accessing Clipboard**

Will your clipboard be read secretly, without letting you know?

No. We have to admit, getting what is copied on the background can be convenient. But this is not possible on iOS, reading clipboard requires the app to be active.

Also, if you are using iOS 14, the system will notify you every single clipboard operation, and you cannot even capture the clipboard data using a widget (Instead, you can press a button that redirects you to the app).

**iCloud Sync**

Taio implements iCloud sync for most features, it uses the iCloud service provided by Apple. As you can imagine, this service is fairly secure and trusted by users around the world.

More importantly, there's nothing to do with our service, no data will be sent to our server. In fact, we don't even have a server for that.

**Data Collected by Taio**

In short, the Taio app itself does not collect any data from you. Yes, we don't do any data tracking technology for "Growth Hacking" purpose, we don't even count how many users we have. We just want to provide a safe text processing environment, and do not care how "success" we are, or how the app is being used by users.

But you should be careful about using some APIs that may request your data, such as location, calendar, and reminders. Especially when you are running an actions that is provided by a third-party organization, double-check it before running.

Other than that, please be confident about our service, all secrets stay on your device, we don't have control over them.

**Cookies**

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

Taio does not use these "cookies" explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code or websites that may collect cookies to improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
