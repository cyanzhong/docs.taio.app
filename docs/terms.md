## Terms of Service

Thanks for using Taio, your support directly sustains the development. Taio has no venture capital or corporation backing it, we are trying to bring the best experience to users as a really small indie team.

**Pricing**

Taio's core features, such as clipboard management and Markdown editor, are free. We also offer **Taio Pro** edition, designed to meet the needs of professional users for more customization while maintaining our development efforts.

Taio Pro offers a variety of pricing strategies to fit different situations, such as monthly subscriptions, annual subscriptions, or one-time payment for lifetime premium, with **full functionality** free trials for subscription models. In addition, we are offering a further `Early Bird` price for existing users who have downloaded earlier versions (v1.12.0 and earlier).

It is also worth mentioning that with subscription models, the discounted price you use will be kept in the renewal and will not increase with subsequent product price increases. Also, lifetime plan works for all future updates, including major ones.

If you are interested, please find out more on our [website](https://taio.app/#pricing), thanks for your support.
