# FAQ

## Are there file services other than iCloud?

Taio currently supports iCloud Drive, and we are considering adding services like OneDrive or other commonly used cloud storage services. In addition, a WebDAV based file transfer method is also planned.

## Is there an action sharing community?

We are working on it, please stay tuned.

## Why aren't widgets interactive?

Due to system limitations, all third-party apps in iOS 14 and macOS 11 are not interactive.

However, Taio provides full support for Shortcuts, by leveraging its widgets, you can save data without opening the app. Please refer to our [guides](integration/shortcuts.md) to set it up if necessary.

## Why isn't the widget updating?

There are some restrictions on how often third-party widgets can be refreshed, refreshes are strictly budgeted. There is no perfect solution to work around this issue, please try it again later, thanks for your understanding.

## Why doesn't iCloud sync work?

We use system's iCloud Drive service directly, which means we can't interfere with the synchronization process too much. In many cases, iCloud Cloud service is affected by the network environment, so we suggest that you try switching networks or be patient when you encounter problems.
