# FAQ

## Is there a macOS app?

Thank you for your interest in Taio. We are working on a macOS version, but will not be releasing it soon. For now, improving the iOS and iPadOS experience remains a priority, and we will optimize the iPadOS experience while ensuring compatibility with macOS and release it when it is truly ready.

## Are there file services other than iCloud?

Taio currently supports iCloud Drive, and we are considering adding services like OneDrive or other commonly used cloud storage services. In addition, a WebDAV based file transfer method is also planned.

## Is there an action sharing community?

We are working on it, please stay tuned.

## Why aren't widgets interactive?

Due to system limitations, all third-party apps in iOS 14 are not interactive.

However, Taio provides full support for Shortcuts, by leveraging its widgets, you can save data without opening the app. Please refer to our [guides](integration/shortcuts.md) to set it up if necessary.

## Why isn't the widget updating?

iOS has some restrictions on how often third-party widgets can be refreshed, refreshes are strictly budgeted. There is no perfect solution to work around this issue, please try it again later, thanks for your understanding.

## Why doesn't iCloud sync work?

We use system's iCloud Drive service directly, which means we can't interfere with the synchronization process too much. In many cases, iCloud Cloud service is affected by the network environment, so we suggest that you try switching networks or be patient when you encounter problems.

## What's the pricing model?

Taio's goal is to be a high quality product, and in the early stages of development we do not charge for it, feel free to try it out. In later versions, we may charge for some advanced features to maintain the cost of development, please refer to our [Terms of Service](terms.md) for more information.
