The following is a quick introduction, for more information on how to use Shortcuts, please refer to the [user guide](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) provided by Apple.

To use iOS built-in accessibility features, such as "Back Tap", please refer to the [tutorial](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211781) provided by Apple.

## Run Actions

Other than specify the action name, you can also provide an input value:

It will open the Taio app and launch the specified actions.

## Save Clipping

With a simple setup, you can save the clipboard content to Taio:

By leveraging home screen widgets supported by Shortcuts, you can do that without launching the app.
